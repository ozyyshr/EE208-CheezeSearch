Following a fall in the Shanghai market, Chinese Cinderella is whisked away to Grandma Wu's house to recover. As she lapses in and out of consciousness, she is haunted by vivid dreams that seem strange - yet somehow familiar - to her. A tale of slavery and friendship, wealth, poverty and an arranged marriage begins, as Chinese Cinderella recalls a life lived centuries before. But is it real, or all in her imagination . . .
