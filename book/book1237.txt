Two top business professors offer up the only negotiation book you'll ever needDo you know what you want? How can you make sure you get it? Or rather, how can you convince others to give it to you? Almost every interaction involves negotiation, yet we often miss the cues that would allow us to make the most of these exchanges. In Getting (More of) What You Want, Margaret Neale and Thomas Lys draw on the latest advances in psychology and behavioral economics to provide new strategies for negotiation that take into account people's irrational biases as well as their rational behaviors. Whether you're shopping for a car, lobbying for a raise, or simply haggling over who takes out the trash, Getting (More of) What You Want shows how negotiations regularly leave significant value on the table-and how you can claim it.
